### This is a bunch of stuff to convert floating point nunber from BH1750 sensor to uint8_t 32 byte array like in https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/cryptographic-co-processor-atecc508a-qwiic-hookup-guide/example-2-sign

There is a lot of cruff built up here from reapeated experiments, but See: [
returnArraysFromFunc6_8shortI_scratch3_5.c (float to IEEE754 binary) , /changearray/ifstructures/loopbyFour/example1_2_9f.c (binary to hex array if the mergeChars function can be fixed. (Use gdb and valgrind))
